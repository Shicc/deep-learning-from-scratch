# deep learning from scratch(2018.2)
Dive into deep learning from scratch with a simple demo

Many students began to study deep learning with mninst,but most of them don't know how to do a deep learning project from scratch and can't understand the algorithm well.The best way to help you to dive into deep learning and understand the algorithm is to do a project from scratch which we will do it from data preprocessing to model building.Finally we will train the model with training data and test the 
accuracy of model with test data.
